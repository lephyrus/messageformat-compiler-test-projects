These are projects to test
[ngx-translate-messageformat-compiler](https://github.com/lephyrus/ngx-translate-messageformat-compiler)
with different versions of its peer dependencies, especially
Angular. This is not so much about seeing if the library code works as
intended, but more about seeing if the build process (both dev and
prod) works.
